 # list
 1. Write a program to search an element from a list. Give user the option to perform Linear or Binary search. Use Template functions.
2. WAP using templates to sort a list of elements. Give user the option to perform sorting using Insertion sort, Bubble sort or Selection sort.
3. Implement Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and search of a number, reverse the list and concatenate two linked lists (include a function and also overload operator +).
4. Implement Doubly Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and search of a number, reverse the list.
5. Implement Circular Linked List using templates. Include functions for insertion, deletion and search of a number, reverse the list.
6. Perform Stack operations using Linked List implementation.
7. Perform Stack operations using Array implementation. Use Templates.
8. Perform Queues operations using Circular Array implementation. Use Templates.
9. Create and perform different operations on Double-ended Queues using Linked List implementation.
10. WAP to scan a polynomial using linked list and add two polynomial.
